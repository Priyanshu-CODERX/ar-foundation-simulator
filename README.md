# Realtime AR Simulation in ARFoundation
Recently Unity released their simulator for ARFoundation to test the AR applications within the editor without having to build the apk and then test it on mobile, it can help the developers to test the AR applications within Unity Engine only rather than building it which saves a lot of time, although as the packages are still in Pre Release, I wouldn't recommend to use it in the production.

# Development Environment:
- Unity Engine 2021.3.1f1
- ARFoundation 5.0.0-pre.12
- ARCore XR Plugin 5.0.0-pre.12
